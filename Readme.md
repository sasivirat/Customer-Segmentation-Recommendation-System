# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System  

## 🌐 **Overview**  
This project explores customer analytics within the dynamic online retail sector using transactional data from a UK-based retailer (2010–2011) sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. By leveraging clustering and recommendation techniques, we aim to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales through customer insights.  

---

## 🌟 **Problem Statement**  
We aim to transform transactional data into meaningful insights by:  
- Segmenting customers into distinct groups using K-means clustering to understand their preferences.  
- Developing a recommendation system to suggest top-selling products for each customer cluster, improving marketing efficiency.

## 🎯 **Objectives**  

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new customer-centric features.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Apply scaling and dimensionality reduction for better clustering efficiency.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers using K-means clustering.  
- **Cluster Analysis:** Analyze clusters to develop tailored marketing strategies.  
- **Recommendation System:** Recommend popular products within each cluster for improved sales.
